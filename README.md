## Installation

It is recommended to install [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) through the `npm` package manager, which comes bundled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) when you install it on your system. It is recommended to use a Node.js version `>= 16.0.0`.

Once you have `npm` installed, you can run the following both to install and upgrade Yarn:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

After having installed Yarn, simply run:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running Deployments

**Example Rinkeby:**

```bash
yarn deploy:rinkeby
```

> The deployment script [`deploy.ts`](./scripts/deploy.ts) includes the `tenderly` Hardhat Runtime Environment (HRE) extension with the `verify` method. Please consider configuring the Tenderly `project` and `username` in the [`hardhat.config.ts`](./hardhat.config.ts) file before deploying or remove this call.

## Running `CREATE2` Deployments

```bash
yarn xdeploy
```

This template uses the [xdeploy](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/xdeployer) Hardhat plugin. Check out the documentation for more information on the specifics of the deployments.

## `.env` File

In the `.env` file place the private key of your wallet in the `PRIVATE_KEY` section. This allows secure access to your wallet to use with both testnet and mainnet funds during Hardhat deployments. For more information on how this works, please read the documentation of the `npm` package [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

## Contract Verification

Change the contract address to your contract after the deployment has been successful. This works for both testnet and mainnet. You will need to get an API key from [etherscan](https://etherscan.io), [snowtrace](https://snowtrace.io) etc.

**Example:**

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network fantomMain <YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --constructor-args deploy-arg.ts
```
